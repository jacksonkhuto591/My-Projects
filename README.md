# My-Projects
This repository contains a Snake game that I created using Java and Blue J as part of a school project. The game is fully functional and includes features such as score tracking, level progression, and game over detection.

The game is built using Object-Oriented programming principles, with a modular and well-organized codebase. The game mechanics are implemented using Java's Swing library, with custom graphics and sound effects.

As the team leader for this project, I was responsible for managing the project timeline, delegating tasks, and ensuring that the team was on track to meet our project goals. I also contributed to the codebase, including designing the game mechanics and debugging issues.

This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in team collaboration, project management, and programming skills. It also allowed me to demonstrate my creativity and attention to detail, which are essential skills in software development.

Feel free to take a look at the code and provide any feedback or suggestions. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and create better software!
